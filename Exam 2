Q1: Explain the engineering design trade-offs surrounding dynamic load control. Begin by describing what load control 
is and then explain the nature of the balancing act the OS needs to perform. In other words, explain the design 
tradeoff surrounding modulating the number of concurrent processes ?

Q2: Explain the engineering design trade-off present between static address translation, and dynamic address translation.
Begin by giving a definition for both and then list in detail the benefits and drawbacks of each.

Q3: In the figure below you will find a resource allocation graph for a system in a particular state of resource 
allocations and requests. Use static deadlock detection to determine if the system is in a deadlocked state

Q4: There are 2048 addressable locations in a particular logical address space. The address space is divided into pages of 32 addresses each. How many bits k are 
required to address all the locations in a page? How many bits n are required to address all of the pages Show your work.

Q5: What are the four conditions required for experiencing resource deadlock. List each, and give a brief
description of each. Then, also list at least one static deadlock prevention technique which addresses each 
one of the four (1 technique per condition).

Q6: We have previously seen the chart below. numenically. I have intentionally removed the labels from this chart. Label 
the x and y axes. Also, label the region where thrashing occurs. What does the dotted line represent? What situation 
is represented under the curve to the left of the line? What situation is represented under the curve to the right of 
the line  ( Figure: rhis figure is in presentaion)

Q7: The below table represents several entries in the physical frame numbers on the right) for a certe page table logical alate the logical addre 01001010 to the appropriate physical address. Show your work

Q8: Explain how "external fragmentation" emerges in memory management systems. Also give a solution for eliminating it

Q9: The vectors and matrices below represent the current state of a system. E is "existing". A is "available", C is 
currently acquired, and R is maximum remaining. Use the banker's algorithm to determine if the system is in a safe state. Show your work

Q10: What is the translation lookaside buffer and why is it useful? What problem does it help solve? Be specific.

Q11: Begin with the following Reference String: 3 0 2 1 4 5 0 1 0 3. For a paged memory comsusting of 4 frames, use the
Least-Recently Used page replacement algorithm to show for tune 1 through 10 what pages are resident in each frame,
and what the state of the queue is. Also, indicate when page faults occur
